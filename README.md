SteelCrypt
==========

SteelCrypt is a open-source and free crypto library written in Ada.

The aims are:

* provide a unified, generic and easy to use API
* provide secure and safe implementations which maybe get formal verification (somewhere in the distant future)
* implement the algorithms in an efficient way

This is preliminary work to implement a secure and safe TLS library.
